## Introduction
My name is **Bryson Palmer** and I'm a student web developer. I'm currently in a *full stack* web developer bootcamp through the *University of Washington* under *Trilogy Education Services*. I'm looking to get into web development for my professional work. I plan on being a capable, creative, team oriented developer by the end of this program. I look forward to implementing this new skill in future employment.

## <a id="future-tickets"></a> üîç Future Tickets
* I would like to add a modal to handle the `Clear All` button, text information, and function. That way it gives the user a second chance from deleting all of their data entries.

* I would like to add a double click feature to the save button to strike through the text of the selected hour.

## <a id="other-information" /></a> üì° Other Information
* Installation: Go to the live link <a href="https://github.com/Bryson-Palmer/Day-Planner.git">[Here]</a> and start planning your day. That's it!
* Usage: A planner app for those wanting to get the most out of their day.
* Credits: I followed the instructor's homework demo from class to set up my initial files. I used google, w3 schoolsl, and web md sites to understand and implement the techniques used. I also went over previous activities to get an understanding of jquery, bootstrap, on(clicks), DOM traversal, and local storage. I'd also like to thank fellow student Daniel Soledad for helping me find my error in getting my local storage out and displayed in the text area.
